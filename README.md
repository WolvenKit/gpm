# GPM - Games Package Manager
Main repository for the official Games Package Manager CLI's specification.

## The CLI
> There is an ongoing draft about the cli [here](https://github.com/WolvenKit/CP77Wiki/wiki/GPM-(Draft)), it probably move in this repository in the future

## Choices made for the CLI

### Why VFS, and what is VFS
> Anyone with more knowledge should probably explain why VFS (and not symlinks)

### Why a CLI and not a GUI
An independant CLI means anyone can make a GUI on top of this CLI and use the full power of it. We opted for a CLI because it is easier for us, developers to use CLIs than GUI. And as said above a CLI means anyone can build a tool on top of it.
